## 一、面试题

### 1. Java8 中有哪些线程池

### 2. 线程池的执行流程

### 3. 线程池的拒绝策略

```java
    /**
     * A handler for rejected tasks that runs the rejected task
     * directly in the calling thread of the {@code execute} method,
     * unless the executor has been shut down, in which case the task
     * is discarded.
     */
    public static class CallerRunsPolicy implements RejectedExecutionHandler {
        /**
         * Creates a {@code CallerRunsPolicy}.
         */
        public CallerRunsPolicy() { }

        /**
         * Executes task r in the caller's thread, unless the executor
         * has been shut down, in which case the task is discarded.
         *
         * @param r the runnable task requested to be executed
         * @param e the executor attempting to execute this task
         */
        public void rejectedExecution(Runnable r, ThreadPoolExecutor e) {
            if (!e.isShutdown()) {
                r.run();
            }
        }
    }

    /**
     * A handler for rejected tasks that throws a
     * {@code RejectedExecutionException}.
     */
    public static class AbortPolicy implements RejectedExecutionHandler {
        /**
         * Creates an {@code AbortPolicy}.
         */
        public AbortPolicy() { }

        /**
         * Always throws RejectedExecutionException.
         *
         * @param r the runnable task requested to be executed
         * @param e the executor attempting to execute this task
         * @throws RejectedExecutionException always
         */
        public void rejectedExecution(Runnable r, ThreadPoolExecutor e) {
            throw new RejectedExecutionException("Task " + r.toString() +
                                                 " rejected from " +
                                                 e.toString());
        }
    }

    /**
     * A handler for rejected tasks that silently discards the
     * rejected task.
     */
    public static class DiscardPolicy implements RejectedExecutionHandler {
        /**
         * Creates a {@code DiscardPolicy}.
         */
        public DiscardPolicy() { }

        /**
         * Does nothing, which has the effect of discarding task r.
         *
         * @param r the runnable task requested to be executed
         * @param e the executor attempting to execute this task
         */
        public void rejectedExecution(Runnable r, ThreadPoolExecutor e) {
        }
    }

    /**
     * A handler for rejected tasks that discards the oldest unhandled
     * request and then retries {@code execute}, unless the executor
     * is shut down, in which case the task is discarded.
     */
    public static class DiscardOldestPolicy implements RejectedExecutionHandler {

        public DiscardOldestPolicy() { }

        /**
         * Obtains and ignores the next task that the executor
         * would otherwise execute, if one is immediately available,
         * and then retries execution of task r, unless the executor
         * is shut down, in which case task r is instead discarded.
         *
         * @param r the runnable task requested to be executed
         * @param e the executor attempting to execute this task
         */
        public void rejectedExecution(Runnable r, ThreadPoolExecutor e) {
            if (!e.isShutdown()) {
                e.getQueue().poll();
                e.execute(r);
            }
        }
    }
```

### 4. 线程池的核心参数有哪些

```java
public class ThreadPoolExecutor extends AbstractExecutorService {
    private volatile int corePoolSize; // 核心线程数
    private volatile int maximumPoolSize; // 最大线程数
    private volatile long keepAliveTime; // 保活时间
    private final BlockingQueue<Runnable> workQueue;
    private volatile ThreadFactory threadFactory;
    private volatile RejectedExecutionHandler handler;

    private volatile boolean allowCoreThreadTimeOut; // 是否允许核心线程销毁
}
TimeUnit timeUnit // 时间单位
```
